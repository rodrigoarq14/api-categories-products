## Additional Information ‚ûï

### Frontend Project in React

In addition to the RESTful API, there is a frontend project developed in React that serves as a user interface to consume this API. You can find the repository of the project at the following link:

[Project Repository](https://github.com/rodrigoarq14/categories-products-react)

### Postman Requests Collection

At the root of this project, you will find a JSON file that contains a collection of Postman requests. This collection provides a series of predefined requests that you can import into the Postman tool to easily test the CRUD operations for both categories and products in the RESTful API.

If you want to test the API requests using Postman, you can import this JSON file into your Postman instance and start making requests to the API immediately.
